# Design Patterns

## 1. Access Control Design Patterns

- Restricting Access
    - A very simple form of access control is making contract state private. 
    - We cannot prevent people or computer programs from reading your contracts’ state.
    - The state is publicly available information for anyone with access to the blockchain. 
    - We can restrict other contracts’ access to the state by making state variables private.
- Ownable

## 2. Inheritance and Interfaces
